    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Thien or Sky, either name works. I'm a 14 year old transfem autistic teenager that's constantly bored, well until I found a couple really good people. I love them a lot &lt;3!
      <br>
      Yeah as you can tell, I am <i>super</i> biromantic although I don't really have that much sexual feelings about them. And yeah, I'm polyamorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the things I like are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fictional Googology, the study of numbers beyond Absolute Infinity. I have an entire <NuxtLink to="/bbn">organization</NuxtLink> dedicated to this.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designing, especially if I can add a lot of details. And some stories too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Programming, albeit not that good at that. I mostly only know web dev. Systems/low-level stuff (like rust, C++, zig) or server-side stuff (like go and python) I don't know as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some of the stuff I do can be found here at my GitHub account: <NuxtLink to="https://github.com/Thien-Hubbing" target="_blank">https://github.com/Thien-Hubbing</NuxtLink>
      </li>
      <li>
        And, you guys! I love y'all! &lt;3
      </li>
    </ul>
