so yesterday on october 8th one of the worst situations i've ever encountered happened, which resulted in me leaving from FG completely and also deleting the FG fanclub and dismantling the BBN Foundation entirely.

i keep having this recurring thought, which is why didn't i do it sooner? i had multiple chances, to spare myself from the misery that would inevitably lead us back here. i didn't. i fucked it up. and now everything is gone. and everyone hates me.

i got people like oliver desperately trying to convince everyone to abandon me and pixel keeps fighting against him, stella being vague and weird instead of just plainly saying she hates me, and others just trying to make fun of me because of "a fight over fictional numbers".

what was once my only sancutary from the hostile reality turned into a hell of its own. of course, it's all my fault. everything always is.

i know i wanna do better, but like, what is **better**?? i'm trying to work for something i don't even know.

## what now?
i'm banned from the NO! server, per my request. i left every server except for some emoji related servers. i made a new server, won't have anything to do with fg.

i don't even know where i would go from here. everything is gonna stress me further. i can't really "rest" cause i don't know what resting means. i thought about, you know, but the reason i haven't really done that is well more pain. and i also wanna live to see the day where i meet them irl.

also death is kinda painful, not surprising.

i got rid of all references to "fictional googology" from uh this website, and now that i'm completely detached, well... i don't know.

i'll see you later i guess. if you wanna talk to me, see <NuxtLink to="/about">here</NuxtLink>.
