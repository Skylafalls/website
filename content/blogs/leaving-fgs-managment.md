I'm gonna stop trying to manage the bullshit that has continually spiraled across the past few months I have been in this community.

Why? Simple, it's just too fucking difficult now. I can't handle scaling the entries, moderating the [NO! server](https://discord.gg/YcZGhYYJUU), and [the fg wiki](https://fictional-googology.fandom.com), among well, a lot of other things. I can't do it, especially if I'm alone.

I also do not like how I'm constantly being ridiculed for what?? I hate when people think I am much deeper then I actually am, I am quite surface-level.

What does this mean for the projects I'm working on, and the places I'm at? Realistically, shouldn't mean anything. For the Discord servers I'm in, I would only be within the [FG Fanclub](https://discord.gg/9PGMnJfheJ) server now, although I'll still talk in some others like Jesse Kohn's and JoshuaDR.0809's server.

Yeah, overall, I don't want to babysit insane people, and from what I have seen, you guys want to be insane.

Get your shit together people, I am tired of trying to fix what is obviously fixable, but that you guys keep breaking.
