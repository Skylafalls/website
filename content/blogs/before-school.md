So, I'm back in FG again. I guess a 3 day break was enough for me, interesting.

Anyways, a few changes occured, I now own the [FG-YT Wiki](https://fgyt.fandom.com/wiki/The_Numerical_Storage_Wiki) after the previous owner decided to leave that wiki for a different one, only to return after it got semi-popular again.

Commenting is finally back on for the FG Expansion Spreadsheet, and I still haven't started on episode 11 of CTTSOFG yet. I really just don't feel like doing that.

The spreadsheet in question by the way needs more charts, I want more details and shit on that spreadsheet. Same for the FG-YT wiki I mentioned, it also needs more articles and details on such.

Can you guys help me with that and expand the pages and the spreadsheet? Anyways, that'll be all for me, on the very last day of summer for me, the day before I have to go to school again.

Hopefully, it won't be hell.
